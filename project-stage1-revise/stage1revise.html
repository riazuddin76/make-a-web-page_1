        <b>How the Web Works</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
        each other. When a person goes to a web page like
        www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em>
        to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate
        HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where
        a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it
        on the user's screen.

        does a good job of explaining more.

        <b>HTML</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML
        documents form the majority of the content on the web.
        HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes
        "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it
        looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a>
        gives a good overview.

        <b>Tags and Elements</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
        writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element
        by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
        <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
        explains the distinction well.

        <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
        literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small
        mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

        <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
        Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
        content inside of them.

        <b>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
        Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
        content inside of them.

        <b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
        draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had
        multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        <br>
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
        nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
        boxes, and so on...
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
        of changing indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
        deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

        <b>Text Editors (for programming)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like
        Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's
        life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
        generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

        <b>Box Sizing</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
  <br>Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
  <br>There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
  <br>Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.
  <br>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.
